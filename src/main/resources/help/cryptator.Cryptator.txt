The cryptator program is constraint-based cryptarithm solver.
The program builds a constraint programming model for each cryptarithm given as parameters.
A cryptarithm is defined by a classical grammar for equations.
The model is then solved by choco solver.

The program takes options for configuring the cryptarithm, the solver, the model, the output, ...
