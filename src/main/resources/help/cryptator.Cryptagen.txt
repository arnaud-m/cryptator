The cryptagen program is constraint-based cryptarithm generator.
The generation takes a word list as input and generate candidates cryptarithms under constraints.
Each word parameter can either be a simple word or the pathname of a word list.
Each candidate cryptarithm is then solved and the decision is made whether to keep it.

The program takes options for configuring the cryptarithm, the generation and solution solvers, the model, the output, ...
