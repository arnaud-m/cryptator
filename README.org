Cryptator is distributed under BSD 3-Clause License (Copyright (c) 2021, Université Côte d'Azur).

Cryptator is a cryptarithm solver using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming][Constraint Programming]].\\
It is based on [[https://github.com/chocoteam/choco-solver][choco-solver]] which is an open-source Java library for Constraint Programming.

* About cryptarithms
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic][Cryptarithm]], or alphametic, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters of the alphabet.

  - [[http://cryptarithms.awardspace.us/][Cryptarithms Online]], Jorge A. C. B. Soares - it contains the Sphinx collection, link, books.

* Download and Installation

  In the following, we distinguish two usages:
    - as a standalone application: the jar file includes all required dependencies,
    - as a library: the jar file excludes all dependencies.

** Prerequisites
  This project works on 32 bits and 64 bits environment and requires:

  - JDK 8+
  - Maven 3+

** As a stand-alone application

   This project uses the Cross-platform Maven build system.
   : mvn clean package
   or to skip unit tests
   : mvn clean package -DskipTests=true

   The jar file contains all required dependencies.
   The next step is simply to run one of the console applications.
   The links point to demonstration scripts.

 - *solve a cryptarithm* with [[file:src/main/shell/demo-solve.sh][Cryptator]].
 - *generate cryptarithms* with [[file:src/main/shell/demo-generate.sh][Cryptagen]] (see the [[file:src/main/shell/demo-generate-output.md][demo output]]).
 - *play the game* with [[file:src/main/shell/demo-play.sh][Cryptamancer]].


    Execute the main classe without argument to display the help message.
** As a library

   The jar file does not contains any dependencies, as of being used as a dependency of another application.
   The next step is to add the jar file to your classpath of your application and also add the required dependencies.

*** Inside a maven project

    First, you must build from source and install it into your local .m2 repository.
    : mvn install

    Then, you only have to edit your pom.xml to declare the following library dependency:

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 <dependency>
    <groupId>fr.univ-cotedazur</groupId>
    <artifactId>cryptator</artifactId>
    <version>0.4.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
 </dependency>
 #+END_EXAMPLE

** Integration tests
 The tests solve around 150 cryptarithms.
 By default, the tests are not executed by the regular maven lifecycle test execution.
 Indeed, their names are outside of the standard maven test runner nomenclature.

 Just include it manually by feeding it as a parameter to the runner.

 : mvn test -Dtest=ExtensiveTesting
